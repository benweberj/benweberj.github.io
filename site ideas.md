#properties of the site
- the themed-page idea was dope, but maybe just make this site super clean and maybe not even have a navbar
- logos that had previous versions should have a button to press to show those versions
- each of the games/animations should have a UI to change the settings of them
- java pixelation should have the option to preview different sampling methods (center, random, average). Also diagrams for each
- UPDATE: make the pixelation its own site and make it seem like its education and shows the difference between each sampling method. Site should have a side-by-side comparison
- now that I think about it, maybe have the swing game be its own site too
- not sure if each class should include gpa but it should have a description. Probably link 154 projects here (sites require a server so idk how youre gonna do that)
- start with real pic of my face (take new one) then when they hover over it, have it drop and reveal a vectorized version. OH FUCK you could just use the current vector pic and just make the real pic the bridge one that you referenced from.


#things to do
- polish up the swing game and make it so a lot of things are paramater-controlled
- rewrite the pixelation in js or figure out how to embed java into the site
- have the matrix animation use vatiable-length english words rather than random katakana symbols
